# Weather_Forecast
This project predicts Toronto's weather using historical data from Wunderground. It involves data scraping, preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying regression and time series models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, ARIMA). Metrics like RMSE and R-squared identify the most accurate model for better weather prediction.
This project aims to predict Toronto's weather using historical data sourced from "https://www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/CYTZ/date/". The workflow involves data scraping, rigorous preprocessing, and feature engineering to extract valuable insights. Multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net, XGBoost) and time series methods (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) are applied for weather forecasting. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, RMSE, MAE, and R-squared are employed to compare model performances. The goal is to determine the most accurate model to enhance weather prediction accuracy, benefiting various sectors reliant on precise weather forecasts and contributing to meteorological advancements.
INTRODUCTION
In order to effectively predict weather patterns, meteorological forecasting has become more and more dependent on sophisticated machine learning techniques. The objective of this project is to create a reliable prediction model by utilizing historical weather data from Toronto, Ontario, Canada, which can be accessed at "https://www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/CYTZ/date/". To assure the quality and relevance of the dataset, the project's pipeline starts with careful data gathering and continues with substantial preprocessing and feature engineering.Regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net, and XGBoost) are used and extensively assessed in order to anticipate meteorological conditions. To fully capture the complex temporal correlations and seasonality present in meteorological data, time series forecasting techniques like ARIMA and exponentialsmoothing are also used.Evaluating and contrasting the performance of these various models and time series approaches is the main goal. The predictive power of each model is carefully examined using evaluation criteria such as accuracy, RMSE, MAE, and R-squared. Finding the most reliable and accurate model to forecast Toronto's weather patterns is the main objective of the research. The ultimate goal of this work is to improve meteorological prediction models, which will provide essential information to a variety of industries that depend on accurate and consistent weather predictions.
