# Weather_Forecast
This project predicts Toronto's weather using historical data from Wunderground. It involves data scraping, preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying regression and time series models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, ARIMA). Metrics like RMSE and R-squared identify the most accurate model for better weather prediction.
