# Weather_Forecast
This project predicts Toronto's weather using historical data from Wunderground. It involves data scraping, preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying regression and time series models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, ARIMA). Metrics like RMSE and R-squared identify the most accurate model for better weather prediction.
This project aims to predict Toronto's weather using historical data sourced from Wunderground. The workflow involves data scraping, rigorous preprocessing, and feature engineering to extract valuable insights. Multiple regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net, XGBoost) and time series methods (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) are applied for weather forecasting. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, RMSE, MAE, and R-squared are employed to compare model performances. The goal is to determine the most accurate model to enhance weather prediction accuracy, benefiting various sectors reliant on precise weather forecasts and contributing to meteorological advancements. This project underscores the increasing dependence of meteorological forecasting on sophisticated machine learning techniques, aiming to create a reliable prediction model by utilizing historical weather data from Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The project's pipeline starts with careful data gathering and continues with substantial preprocessing and feature engineering to ensure data quality and relevance. By evaluating and contrasting the performance of various models and time series approaches, the research seeks to find the most reliable and accurate model for forecasting Toronto's weather patterns, ultimately providing essential information to industries dependent on accurate and consistent weather predictions.
